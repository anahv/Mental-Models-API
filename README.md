# Mental Models API

A RESTful API that contains mental models from the book "Super Thinking: Upgrade Your Reasoning and Make Better Decisions with Mental Models" (2019) by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann.

This API is consumed on my other project, Nugget-for-Web, which displays a different mental model every time you log in (or refresh) inside your Nugget dashboard.
