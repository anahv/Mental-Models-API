# Mental Models API

A RESTful API that contains mental models from the book "Super Thinking: Upgrade Your Reasoning and Make Better Decisions with Mental Models" (2019) by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann.

This API is consumed on my other project, [Nugget for Web](https://github.com/anahv/Nugget-for-Web), which displays a random mental model every time you log in or refresh.

This app also includes a cron scheduler function that sends an SMS with a random mental model every day at 8am, using Twilio.

Deployed in Heroku with a GET all method: https://mental-models.herokapp.com/
